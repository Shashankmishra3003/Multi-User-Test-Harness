Built a tool using WPF and C++ for multi-user testing, which runs a set of tests sequentially and provides exception-safe execution.The tool allows to generate multiple test requests concurrently and return the result of each request in the form of a text file back to the client who generated it. Framework provides the facility of loading tests from multiple DLLs and execute the tests by spawning multiple child processes.
